# MogaML

Machine Learning library implemented from scratch, using raw C and no libraries (gnuplot used for tests)

## Algoritms
- Linear algebra functions including Singular Value Decomposition
- Linear, Ridge, Lasso Regression (+ support for arbitrary loss functions)
- K-Nearest Neighbours
- Logistic Regression
- Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
- K-Means Clustering
- Principle Component Analysis
- Chi-Squared Statistical Analysis
- Feed-Forward Neural Networks with backpropagation
- Linear Discriminant Analysis, Decision Trees, and Hierarchal Clustering (coming soon...)

## Documentation
Generated with Doxygen, view in docs/html/html/index.html

## Testing
Extensive tests available with `make test`, ensure gnuplot is installed
